# RSA - Dept. of Health
It just so happens that a lot of developers have mental health issues, as such, we are going to make things at least 1% better.

This is a collaboration project between the Royal Stack Alliance and AT Products LLC; I might take the lead in it.

## Mental/Emotional Health
### Resources
There will be resources to assist people in mental health issues, as I'm reading a few books on such subjects:
- [I would, but MY DAMN MIND won't let me! (For teen boys)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLZ7ZY9N/ref=mes-dp?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=toEyi&content-id=amzn1.sym.1f80a951-e90e-479a-a207-64c58d749918&pf_rd_p=1f80a951-e90e-479a-a207-64c58d749918&pf_rd_r=BNHX7C6F3P9N1TEGME4E&pd_rd_wg=Er0bl&pd_rd_r=1f920697-df65-4a9b-a4b1-c12abb448d3c)
  - [(For teen girls)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M19ZME7?ref_=dbs_p_pwh_rwt_anx_cl_1&storeType=ebooks)
- [The Bible for Teens](https://www.amazon.com/NIV-Teen-Study-Bible-Zondervan-ebook/dp/B09N8K1PLQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31XT2WBFHIF5Z&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0vZYxxloH14Yk7S-Nty_06E5CDNTBA4q8NjnG13XJWDl9O8M2gwvluZdl_YcegQRFv8b8Z0LZT5B5zNH9GXl3D8Orw5vdERjy7ak6iR8PE3noxWgSj-XGZSGqmLObo_1971OrYTlwarCZdUsWTegvAgyKBqW8d9dunO9_DePVYzv7cpFESMd7zB6KVR7sbRmUz_Qmt1YfXLVetFoWMCkPxHzBdwAwdEytDOi3bmq7wU.Dq4A_QjoK-07AP8pV_62BIsYCNTmC69xxRx2g6hIuxs&dib_tag=se&keywords=Bible+teen+study&qid=1730205956&s=digital-text&sprefix=bi%2Cdigital-text%2C2437&sr=1-1)
  - You can also just get a typical Bible app on your phone too, or [PCs too](https://archive.org/details/TheBibleCollectionDeluxeValuSoftPN10163A2002)

Maybe a bit more in the future...
### Channels
Of course, there will be a general channel where people can speak their minds about how they are or anything in general so other members can talk to them about it.

### Confessions
Talking about yourself can help understand yourself better. For "confessions", there is a bot that can let people anonymously confess to things called [Confessions](https://top.gg/bot/712011923176030229). There can also be a different channel for not anonymously confessing.

### Private Tickets
People can make tickets with only staff to discuss how they are feeling, or just anything, and we will try our best to assist them. Please, do not share anything within these tickets (the only exception is if we need to let law enforcement know in certain cases). This requires the [Ticket bot](https://top.gg/bot/964624470985826374).
