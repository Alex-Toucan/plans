SVS Guide/Tips

- No gathering during SVS except at Gather Node
- Reinforcement can be sent out AFTER shields are up to help neighbors who are
being attack.
- There is a 30min cooldown shields are removed early... plan wisely you take your shields off before it expires.
- Set an alarm to re-shield after 8hrs if shields expires before 22 UTC
- Do NOT attack SvS alliance or any 2446 alliances, only attack cities labeled
invaders that are not at castle (red/gray zone)
- Do NOT send attacks to Castle or Turrets while SvS alliance or any 2446 alliances are holding it.
- Bring friends with you, if you decide to portal to other state to attack cities.
